CALLBACK URLS, APPLICATION NAMES, AND LOGOS

If you're writing a web-based application, you'll most likely want to set a callback URL for it. Feel free to provide us with a callback URL at your convenience. For more information about callback URLs, please see:

You may also provide us with a name and logo URL for your service/application. This will be shown to users during the authentication process.

(Please ensure that your app info complies with the API Terms of Use, particularly with regards to naming and logo use.)
